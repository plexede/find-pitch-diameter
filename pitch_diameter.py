# To calculate the size of a gear:
# The diameter of a gear from its center to its ideal meshing point can be represented as the Pitch Diameter.
# Pitch Diameter = Module * Number of Teeth
# Using this, the ideal distance between two gears can be calculated by finding the sum of both gearsâ€™ pitch diameters and dividing them by two.

# The goal is to input a ratio, and output the number of gear teeth between 3 compound gears.
