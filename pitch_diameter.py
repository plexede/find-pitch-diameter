# To calculate the size of a gear:
# The diameter of a gear from its center to its ideal meshing point can be represented as the Pitch Diameter.
# Pitch Diameter = Module * Number of Teeth
# Using this, the ideal distance between two gears can be calculated by finding the sum of both gearsâ€™ pitch diameters and dividing them by two.
module = 1
# var centerDistance # mm distance between two axles

# centerDistance = (pitchDiameter1 + pitchDiameter2) / 2

centerDistance = 60 # mm
idealPitchDiameter = (2 * centerDistance ) - pitchDiameter1
